# Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)

A **console-based Java application** for managing students, courses, enrollments, and academic records in a campus setting.  
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, Java SE APIs, modern I/O with NIO.2, Streams, Date/Time API, recursion, and design patterns (Singleton, Builder).
